create a folder

in folder, open terminal and run -- npm init -y
now package.json is created

run -- npm i express
now express is installed

create a basic server by creating a file "index.js" and writing some code

run -- node index
server starts

add routes using app.get()

install nodemon in dev env only -- npm i -D nodemon
open package.json and modify scripts
run -- npm run dev

you can also send file instead..see index.js for steps in 3rd commented code

you can then use express.static(path) and app.use() to auto set all static things instead of manually
adding stuff in routes (see next commit or next lines of commented code)
// these things in node can be done with many many many lines of code..that's why express

NOTE THAT GIT COMMITS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ACCURATE TILL "basic rest API" commit

Now you can tidy up and put things into different folder.

Next you can create your own middleware if needed and test it by running url request on postman
and then checking console here on VS terminal (incase you've added console.log code)
